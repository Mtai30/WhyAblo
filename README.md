# Brief Project Description
For our inspirations, we first looked at “Evolution Simulator” on MinuteLabs.io. Here, blobs move around the map, trying to collect the green spheres (i.e food) in order to survive and reproduce, whilst competing against the other blobs for said spheres. This sort of “random life simulation” gameplay is something we wanted to implement in our project, though we instead want to create a fantasy world where adventurers (our version of blobs) constantly fight randomly spawning enemies. Enemies and adventurers that exist for long enough or kill enough of the opposing force will “evolve”. In terms of our game’s appearance, we turned to WorldBox. While we obviously won’t be able to reach the level of design that WorldBox has, we aim for our game to be top down and to be composed of  “tiles” of some kind.

First commit for the Logs? Idk if I'm doing this right. 
Made a separate branch. Realized that TileList and EntityList need to be their own separate classes so I'm getting started on that. Not much work done today, mostly figuring out how branches work. Also in class pair-coding with Jerry, we created the basic "Game" class which has our setup() and draw(). We also started on Tile and most of the Tile() methods. It looks like Jerry did some work on the Entity class but didn't make note of it in the logs.

It looks like Jerry forgot again to log his work. I will remind him again tomorrow. Other than that, everything I did last night kinda just got replaced by what me and Jerry pair-coded in class today, so I just deleted it all. I made no significant progress coding tongiht because I went to a funeral. Will make sure to get more done tomorrow.
